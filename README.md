# DBMS Assignment-2
This repository contains sql files to create tables and data values for these tables. There is an automation script also in python to feed this sql script in your sql server without any effort. It just asks for your sql username and the path of the `.sql` file that has the sql script to be run. 

For example to run script to setup swiggy databse run below command:
```
python3 auto.py
```
OR 
You can just run command 
```
make
```
When asked for path of sql file enter the path (here for swiggy db it will be `./swiggy/swiggy.sql`).
